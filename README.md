# üöÄ TurtleMarket E-commerce Platform

## This **demo** project is a functional (frontend) e-commerce website featuring 100% plastic-free products.

This project emulates a modern e-commerce platform in functionality but uses a more minimalist, laid-back aesthetic in order to match the **imaginary** company's brand. Features include:

* Interactive user shopping experience with a dynamic shopping cart and checkout process.
* Modern login/signup that stores and uses the user's name, email, and password using LocalStorage (reminder: no backend).
* Uses an original logo and unique flairs to give the website a distinctive touch while mirroring modern e-commerce in UX.

‚è≤Ô∏è Current Status: **In progress** --- Some features are still in progress but core components are functional.

‚å®Ô∏è Technologies Used:

- HTML and CSS for basic creation and styling
- Vanilla JS for user interactivity

ü•Ö Future Goals: 

- Enhance user interactivity and experience through features like account management, search component, and a user rewards program.
- Triple check and test against edge cases to optimize functionality in vanilla JavaScript
- Possibly advance to more efficient and scalable frameworks (React, Angular).
